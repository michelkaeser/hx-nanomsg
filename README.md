# hx-nanomsg

> Haxe (C++/Neko) language bindings for the nanomsg library.

## Build steps

You need the `hxcpp` library from `haxelib`:

    haxelib install hxcpp

as well as the `libnanomsg` development and runtime files:

    http://nanomsg.org/  // Linux
    brew install nanomsg // OSX (Homebrew)

afterwards, all is magic:

    git clone -b develop git@github.com:MaddinXx/hx-nanomsg.git
    cd hx-nanomsg
    haxelib run hxcpp -DHXCPP_M64 build/build.hxml

> Use `-DHXCPP_M32` if on 32-bit system!

## Compilation Flags

`-D NANOMSG_LOADLAZY` which will load the `.ndll` method implementations using the `.Lib.loadLazy` method rather than using normal `load`.

## Nullability

Haxe has a special type `Null<T>` which is mainly for documentation purpose and for static platforms (so e.g. `Int` can be `null`). You can find its typedef here: http://api.haxe.org/Null.html

Trying to follow the documentation aspect, all methods that accept a nullable value (e.g. `Null<Bytes>`) can safely be called with `null` - it is ensured they will _not_ throw an Exception or Error.

On the other hand, when a methods returns a value of type `Null<T>` that means, that the returned value may be `null`.
